<2020-03-23 Mon>
- Met online using discord.
- Discussed using Jira, got everyone signed up and invited to the project page.
- Discussed when we'd create a project backlog, decided to leave pending until instruction in class on Tuesday.
- Discussed using how/when we'd handle daily stand-ups. Considered synchronous vs asynchronous, decided to leave the decision pending until class on Tuesday.
- Verified that everyone was able to clone skeleton repository, compile and execute.
